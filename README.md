ON EVENT HANDLER 
On-event handlers, often referred to simply as event handlers, are functions or procedures within a program
that are designed to respond to specific events triggered by user actions or system events. These events could include actions like clicking a button, 
typing into a form field, moving the mouse, or resizing a window. JavaScript is often used to define event handlers that respond to user actions on web pages,
such as clicking on buttons or submitting forms. These event handlers dictate how the web page should react to user input.

Dynamic HTML (DHTML) refers to a combination of technologies used to create dynamic and interactive web content. It involves using a mix of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript to manipulate the structure, appearance, and behavior of web pages in response to user actions or system events. 
DHTML allows web developers to create more engaging and interactive web experiences compared to static HTML pages.

Key components of DHTML include:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML provides the structure and content of a web page. With DHTML, 
HTML is often dynamically modified or updated using JavaScript to reflect changes in response to user interaction.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to define the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements on a web page. 
With DHTML, CSS can be manipulated dynamically to change the appearance of elements, such as their size, color, position, and visibility.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. In the context of DHTML, 
JavaScript is heavily used to manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically, handle user events (such as clicks, mouse movements, and key presses),
and update the content of web pages without requiring a full page reload.

DOM (Document Object Model): The DOM is a programming interface provided by web browsers that represents the structure of HTML documents as a tree-like structure of objects.
JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically modify the content, structure, and style of web pages. With DHTML, developers often use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in real-time to create interactive effects and respond to user input.
